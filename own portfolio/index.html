        <p><h1>Hay Day</h1><br><br>
Hay Day is a freemium mobile farming game developed and published by Supercell. Hay Day was released for iOS on 21 June 2012 and Android on 20 November 2013.[1] According to a 2013 report, Supercell earned $30 million a month from Hay Day and Clash of Clans.[2] In 2013, Hay Day was the fourth highest game in revenue generated.[3]<br><br><h1>Plot</h1>The player's uncle is unable to take care of his farm anymore, so he hands over the responsibility of caring for the farm to the player. The game starts with a scarecrow giving the player a farming tutorial. By selling crops/products, the player earns coins which can be used to buy production buildings, pets and decoration items. By doing so, they also earn experience points (XP), with which they level up. As the game progress, the player is introduced to Angus, a friend of the player's uncle who gives a fishing tutorial. Earlier on, you’re also introduced to Greg, who comes to your farm requesting items, or puts items in his “roadside shop” that you can buy. Greg is a NPC.

Players form into small "neighborhoods", in which the members can assist each other when in need (for example, by requesting multiple items) and can also chat with one another. Players can also trade their goods with the other friends or neighbors from the neighborhood.</p>

Masha and the Bear (Russian: Ма́ша и Медве́дь, romanized: Masha i Medved; Russian pronunciation: [ˈmaʂə i mʲɪdˈvʲetʲ]) is a Russian animated television series created by Oleg Kuzovkov and co-produced by Soyuzmultfilm and Animaccord Animation Studio (Moscow, the Russian Federation), loosely based on the oral children's folk story of the same name.

The first episode was released in 2009.[1] The series has been translated into 25 languages and was broadcast in more than 100 countries.[2] The series was released on Netflix and through NBCUniversal.[3] Treehouse TV acquired Masha and the Bear as well from 2016–present and then has been formerly acquired on Teletoon too.

Many of the episodes have been successful on YouTube. In particular, the Russian-language version of the episode "Маша плюс каша" ("Recipe for Disaster") has more than 4.3 billion views as of June 2020, making it the site's fifth most viewed video of all time, and the most viewed video on YouTube that is not a music video.[4] The remaining top ten most viewed Masha and the Bear videos are: "Bon Appétit", with over 1.3 billion views; "Laundry Day", with over 1.1 billion views; "The Foundling", with over 800 million views; "La Dolce Vita", with over 740 million views; "Hocus-Pocus", with over 680 million views; "One, Two, Three!

The show consists of three full seasons, with 26 episodes each. The first thirteen episodes of the fourth season have been launched already.

For the first season in English, Elsie Fisher – the voice of Agnes, the youngest of the three girls in the Despicable Me films – was chosen to dub the voice of Masha.[3]</p>

    <h1>MY HOBBIES</h1>
    <p>A hobby is a regular activity done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time, not professionally and not for pay. Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more availability in leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time.

Hobbyists may be identified under three sub-categories: casual leisure which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation, serious leisure which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment, and finally project-based leisure which is a short-term often a one-off project that is rewarding.[1]</p>
